# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear regression is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable.


In essence, multiple linear regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression because it involves more than one explanatory variable.
